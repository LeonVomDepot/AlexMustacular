# Alex Mus-tacular
Alex is by far the fittest person in Stardew Valley, but his body doesn't look like that. To make his appearance match his workout (when he's on ""some""" steroids) I developed this mod. Besides, this mod exists to annoy a friend ;)

## Install

1. Download the newest version of this mod from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/96969738?tab=user+files) or the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/Nordmole/AlexMustacular/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP-File and put the folder into the mods folder of SMAPI (mostly located under "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods")

## Options

- Currently, you can select a style for Alex’s clothes. You can choose a dynamic changing system for Alex’s clothes or force a fixed style that is used for all seasons

## Features

- Watch how a very muscular and buffed Alex lives
- Experience the old (and better) hair sprite of Alex

## Credits

A big thanks to [CommanderWaddles](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/64707721) for publishing the modification (NSFW) [... Alex Muscular Sprite](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3388). I use his idea and sprites as base for my modification. The main difference between our mods (and the reason for me to develop this piece of code) is that my version is mostly SFW and compatible with the latest StardewValley Version. I give Alex a shirt and pants, add missing poses and improve his muscularity

Furthermore, a huuuuge thanks for [Pathoschild](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/1552317) to develop [SMAPI](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400) and [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915). This modification uses both of these technologies to run!

Also, huge thanks to [Poltergeist](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/2679113) for the mod [Seasonal Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5450). I was strongly influenced by their outfits and adopted the rough style for my outfits. A direct copy was not possible due to a certain NPC, who found Gus’s protein powder stash.
